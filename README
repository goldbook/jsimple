JSimple is a set of shared Java utility code. It's design goals are to be simple, minimal sized,
with no external dependencies,and friendly to conversion from Java to C# via the Tangible Java
to C# converter.

JSimple code is intended to run on phones--S40 (since it's Java) or Windows Phone (via the
Tangible converter). It can also be run on the sever. Thus it supports cross platform development,
in Java, across all platforms us Nokians develop on.

JSimple includes JSON support currently and will include OAuth and more.

It's currently used by Nokia Connect and PhotosNG projects.
